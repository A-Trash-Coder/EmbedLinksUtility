# The Powercord Link Preview Utility

Powercord Link Preview Utility allows you to know if your image or video is going to display before you even send the message, saving the embarrassment of link previews not showing up when you're using your custom image/video uploader.

### How It Works

Powercord Link Preview Utility automagically detects if you have the `Embed Links` permission in a channel and lets you know if your images will display or not. To let you know if your links will preview, the Utility uses the channel topic to indicate if you have the permission. If you cannot send messages in the channel, the indicator will not display.
